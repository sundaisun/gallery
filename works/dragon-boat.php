        <h3>case study</h3>
        <h1>Dragon Boat Game</h1>
        <p>For many Chinese Americans, the Chinese Dragon boat Festival is a wonderful opportunity for families and friends to unite and celebrate in the rich traditions and heritage of their native country. Since many Chinese Americans have fulfilled their dreams for a better life in America, MetLife decided to seize the opportunity by creating communication that could draw attention to this time-honored event while helping establish more brand engagement with a vast multicultural audience.</p>
        <p>With strong cultural insights of a 2,000 year old boat race, coupled with the strongly identifiable character of Snoopy – the campaign captured the attention of everyday online customers and broadened MetLife’s brand exposure to a nationwide audience. But even more importantly, it positioned MetLife as the #1 Life insurer in the U.S.</p>
