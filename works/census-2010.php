        <h3>case study</h3>
        <h1>Asian-American Media Campaign</h1>
        <p>Every 10 years the U.S. Census Bureau embarks on a massive mission to count our population and ensure accuracy. They hired IW group to help conduct and complete the huge undertaking for the 2010 Census. The campaign focused on an Asian-group centric approach rather than the one-size-fits-all model.</p>
        <p>IW Group worked with the Census Bureau and other partner agencies to plan and execute a comprehensive communications and outreach campaign that included strategic consultation, paid media, earned media, partnerships and collateral development, among others.</p>

           <h4>Challenge</h4>
           <p>Asians generally do not respond to government efforts or initiatives due their general mistrust and lack of understanding. We had to change this perception and foster the relationship between Census representatives and Asian American media and communities. The Asian population also includes a multitude of languages and cultures, which required mobilizing of resources in order to tackle a project of this magnitude.</p>

           <h4>Our Approach</h4>
           <p>The strategy focused on news-information and high profile programs.  We needed to reach everyone.  We utilized broad reach vehicles as well as hyper-local approaches (TV, Print, Digital, OOH and Radio) to cover targeted audiences.</p>
           <p>IW Group conducted one of the industry’s most historic and largest multicultural paid media campaigns in the country. As the U.S. population continues to grow and becomes increasingly diverse, census representatives felt a strong need to reach the diverse and hard-to-count audiences in a culturally appropriate way.</p><p>IW Group coordinated with the Census Bureau and partner agencies to produce 24 television commercials, 62 radio spots, 46 print ads and countless out-of-home materials. The campaign covered 13 Asian languages that reached 17 Asian ethnic groups in the U.S. We also provided Asian-language creative development and collateral support, as well as 41 public service announcements (PSAs) in 23 different languages that aided in the Census Bureau’s own regional outreach efforts.</p>

              <h4>Result</h4>
               <p>The campaign was an extraordinary success. We reached out to over 350+ media outlets and garnered 62.7M impressions. The final mail-back response rate for the 2010 US Census was 72 percent, which exceeded the 67 percent goal set by the Census Bureau. The result was a major achievement considering the increased population diversity, a new political administration and economic climate, polarized voter base, two wars and overall population increase.</p>
