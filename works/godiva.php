        <h3>case study</h3>
        <h1>Godiva Year of the Horse</h1>
        <p>In 2013, IW Group dove straight into launching Godiva in the Chinese segment with a larger test campaign introducing a limited edition Autumn Moon chocolate collection box priced at $50 in CA and NY. The agency not only met their sales goal, but in some cases surpassed the sales, as many people left empty-handed from stores, and all boxes online were sold.</p>
        <p>Following the success of the Autumn Moon campaign, GODIVA decided to establish an ongoing relationship with its Chinese-American consumer.</p>

           <h4>Challenge</h4>
           <p>Launching a luxury chocolate brand, with a specific product in a niche market segment, with limited budgets, whose measure of success was based solely upon sales.  Add to this, the fact that even though this brand is popular in Asia, there had never been any sustained outreach towards Asian-Americans previously.

           <h4>Our Approach</h4>
           <p>Identifying the target audience was crucial to the success of this campaign. The chocolate collections were priced at $38, $50 and $120 - not affordable by all; and working within limited budgets it was imperative to first hone in on our consumer, and then identify the means to reach him/her. The strategy was to have a well-integrated plan with a message that would resonate strongly with our primary audience - GODIVA brings you immense luck with their Year of the Horse collection, so donâ€™t miss out on this limited time offer.</p><p>This was conveyed through advertising, earned media (Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese), press and blogger events, as well as a fully integrated social media activation via Facebook sweepstakes. Lastly, establishing a partnership with a very popular Chinese-American YouTube celebrity singer, who wrote and made a video of a song specially written for GODIVA.</p>
