        <h3>case study</h3>
        <h1>Covered California Affordable Care Act</h1>
        <p>Since California had embraced the Affordable Care Act and was the biggest state with a minority-majority demographic population, it would be looked to as a model for reaching and enrolling millions of uninsured Americans in affordable, quality health insurance.</p>
        <p>The success of the ACA was dependent, to a large extent, on the success of Covered California.</p>

           <h4>Our Approach</h4>
           <p>Communicate a strong single-minded message to multiple Asian ethnicities (Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Filipino) that Covered California is a platform to find health insurance for everyone - no one can be turned away due to pre-existing conditions or un-affordability. This message was carried through TV, radio, print and OOH showing a pan-Asian familyâ€™s medical struggles and the benefits of affordable healthcare for everyone.</p>
